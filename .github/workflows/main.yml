FreeRDP-WebConnect
FreeRDP-WebConnect will be a gateway for seamless access to your RDP-Sessions in any HTML5-compliant browser. In particular it relies on the features

Canvas (http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/)
WebSockets (http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/)
The server side WebSockets implementation handles current RFC6455 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) only, so browsers that implement the older drafts do not work. With RFC6455 being raised to the "Proposed Standard" level, this should change now really soon.

On the server side, a standalone daemon - written in C++ - provides a Web page via HTTPS (or HTTP, if configured) and uses FreeRDP libs to connect as a client to any RDP session.

Although the project is still in a very early development phase (project was started on April 3, 2012), it already can display an RDP session right now.
